===============================
 Celery 1.0 has been released!
===============================

We're happy to announce the release of Celery 1.0.

What is it?
===========

Celery is a task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing.
It is focused on real-time operation, but has support for scheduling as well.

The execution units, called tasks, are executed concurrently on one or
more worker servers, asynchronously (in the background) or synchronously
(wait until ready).

Celery is already used in production to process millions of tasks a day.

It was first created for Django, but is now also usable from Python. It can
also operate with other languages via webhooks.

Stable API
==========

From this version on the API will be considered stable. This means there won't
be any backwards incompatible changes to new minor versions. Changes to the
API needs to be deprecated; so, for example, if we decided to remove a function
that existed in Celery 1.0:

* Celery 1.2 will contain a backwards-compatible replica of the function which
  will raise a ``PendingDeprecationWarning``.
  This warning is silent by default; you need to explicitly turn on display
  of these warnings.
* Celery 1.4 will contain the backwards-compatible replica, but the warning
  will be promoted to a full-fledged ``DeprecationWarning``. This warning
  is loud by default, and will likely be quite annoying.
* Celery 1.6 will remove the feature outright.

See the `Celery Deprecation Timeline`_ for a list of pending removals.

What's new?
===========

* New periodic task service.

  Periodic tasks are no longer dispatched by ``celeryd``, but instead by a
  separate service called ``celerybeat``. This is an optimized, centralized
  service dedicated to your periodic tasks, which means you don't have to
  worry about deadlocks or race conditions any more. But, also it means you
  have to make sure only one instance of this service is running at any one
  time.

  **TIP:** If you're only running a single ``celeryd`` server, you can embed
  ``celerybeat`` inside it. Just add the ``--beat`` argument.

* Tasks are automatically registered

    Registering the tasks manually was getting tedious, so now you don't have
    to anymore. However -- You can still do it manually if you need to, just
    disable :attr:`Task.autoregister`. The concept of abstract task classes
    has also been introduced, this is like django models, where only the
    subclasses of an abstract task is registered.

* Awesome new task decorators

    Write your tasks as regular functions and decorate them.
    There's both :func:`task`, and :func:`periodic_task` decorators.

* Events

    If enabled, the worker is now sending events, telling you what it's
    doing, and wether it's alive or not. This is the basis for the new
    real-time web monitor we're working on.

* Rate limiting

    Global and per task rate limits. 10 tasks a second? or one an hour? You
    got it. It's using the awesome `token bucket algorithm`_, which is
    commonly used for network traffic shaping. It accounts for bursts of
    activity, so your workers won't be bored by having nothing to do.

* Broadcast commands

    You can now revoke tasks if you suddenly change your mind and don't want
    to run the task anyway, or you can rate limit tasks or even shut down the
    worker remotely.

    It doesn't have many commands yet, but we're waiting for broadcast
    commands to reach its full potential. There's a lot of potential here,
    so please share your ideas if you have any.

* Multiple queues

    The worker is now able to receive tasks on multiple queues at once. This
    means you can route tasks to arbitrary workers. Read about the wicked
    routing powers of AMQP, and you will surely end up mighty impressed.

* Platform agnostic message format.

  The message format has been standardized and now uses the ISO-8601 format
  for dates instead of Python datetime objects. This means you can write task
  consumers in other languages than Python (``eceleryd`` anyone?)

* Timely

  Periodic tasks are now scheduled on the clock, i.e. ``timedelta(hours=1)``
  means every hour at :00 minutes, not every hour from the server starts.
  To revert to the previous behaviour you can enable
  :attr:`PeriodicTask.relative`.

* Plus a lot more

To read more about these and other changes in detail, please refer to
the `changelog`_. This document contains crucial information, so if you're
upgrading from a previous version of Celery, be sure to read the entire
change set before you continue.

**TIP:** If you install the :mod:`setproctitle` module you can see which
task each worker process is currently executing in ``ps`` listings.
Just install it using pip: ``pip install setproctitle``.
