 What's new in Celery 2.6
==========================

Celery aims to be a flexible and reliable, best-of-breed solution
to process vast amounts of messages in a distributed fashion, while
providing operations with the tools to maintain such a system.

Celery has a large and diverse community of users and contributors,
you should come join us :ref:`on IRC <irc-channel>`
or :ref:`our mailing-list <mailing-list>`.

To read more about Celery you should visit our `website`_.

While this version is backward compatible with previous versions
it is important that you read the following section.

If you use Celery in combination with Django you must also
read the `django-celery changelog`_ and upgrade to `django-celery 2.6`_.

This version is officially supported on CPython 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.2 and 3.3,
as well as PyPy and Jython.
